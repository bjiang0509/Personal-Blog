# Personal-Blog

This is a personal blog compose of HTML and CSS. 
* `homepage.html ` is the home page of my blog.
* `blog-post.html` is the first blog post titled "Welcome to my blog"
* The css folder contains all of the stylesheets for my blog
* The images folder contains the images used in the blog

All the "Read" links on the blog homepage directs to the same blog post. My goal is to add all my projects to the blog after reviewing Javascript and REACT.
