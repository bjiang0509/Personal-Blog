                        Hi, my name is Bijun Jiang. I graudated from UC Davis in September, 2021. My major is Computer Science and I'm going to do a brief self-intro.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I grew up in a low income community where <b><em>technology</em></b> is a very unfamiliar word. I was gifted a laptop in High School during my Senior year and it's my first time interacting with a computer (interaction aside from typing up essays in Microsoft Words). Through that laptop, I become very interested in the topic of Computer Science. I want to know why the laptop is so smart and how does the Worldwide Web have an answer to nearly everything. So, I chose Computer Science as a major of interest when the time for college applications comes around. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The acceptance email from UC Davis marked the beginning of my programming path. To be honest, I felt lost during the four years of undergrad, because I don't have previous experiences in CS and I don't have a clear career path. I followed all the required courses for graduation (including operation systems, computer languages, object oriented programming, and more). However, I still don't know what I am capable of or what I want to do after graduation. Luckily, I was employed as a part-time Computer Science instructor at Juni Learning and that experience helped me developed a career goal. I fell in love with web development when I am teaching the Javascript courses, so I want to become an web developer. I would use this blog to keep track of my projects and accomplishments.
                    </p>
                    <p>One of my favorite book is <u>Hamlet</u>, because it contains the following quote:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "To be or not to be...that is the question" related to my future,
                        because I can choose who I want to be.
